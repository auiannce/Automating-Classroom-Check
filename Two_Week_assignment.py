'''# Classroom Check Scheduling - Data Squad 25Su  
## Student Room Assignment Based on Full Shift Duration and Proximity Clusters

AUTHOR: Auiannce Euwing '26

This script generates student worker room-check assignments for a two-week period.
Each student's shift is split across two weeks, with rooms evenly divided between the two.
Assignments prioritize high-priority rooms, ensure room availability, and restrict students to one zone per shift.

Workflow Summary:

1. Load Input Data
   - Class schedule: contains room use by day and time.
   - Student shifts: specifies when each student is available.
   - Room list: contains metadata like room names, zone, building, and priority.

2. Data Cleaning and Normalization
   - Class schedule:
     - Filter only confirmed classes.
     - Normalize days (e.g., "Mon" to "Monday").
     - Parse date and time strings into datetime objects.
     - Normalize room lists so that each row maps to one room.
   - Room list:
     - Standardize column names.
     - Extract building name from room code.
     - Normalize zone names and priorities.
   - Student shifts:
     - Convert start and end times to datetime.
     - Normalize day abbreviations to full names.
     - Drop entries with invalid or missing shift information.

3. Build Class Schedule Lookup
   - Construct a fast-access map from (room, day) to all scheduled class time blocks.
   - This allows for quick conflict checking when assigning rooms.

4. Room Assignment Logic
   - For each student:
     - Skip if the shift is too short to fit any rooms.
     - Rank all zones by how many high-priority rooms (priority 1 or 2) remain unassigned.
     - Pick the top zone and try assigning rooms from it.
     - For each candidate room in that zone:
       - Skip if already assigned globally or used in this shift.
       - Skip if there is a class conflict during the studentâ€™s shift.
       - Skip if not enough time remains in the shift.
       - Otherwise, assign the room, mark it as used, and update time used.

   - Each student is limited to one zone per shift.

5. Week Splitting Logic
   - After all assignments are collected:
     - Each student's shift on a day is split into two parts (Week 1 and Week 2).
     - Rooms are divided as evenly as possible between the two weeks.
     - The `Day` column is updated to reflect the week, e.g., "Monday 1", "Monday 2".

6. Output
   - Saves the final two-week assignment table as:
     - `Output/two_weeks_assignments.csv`
   - Columns included:
     - Student, Day, Shift Start, Shift End, Room, Building, Zone, Priority, Room Type

Constants Used:
- ROOM_CHECK_TIME: Baseline time to check one room (10 minutes)
- HALF_TIME_FACTOR: Multiplier to reduce check time per room (0.5)
- EFFECTIVE_ROOM_CHECK_TIME: Adjusted time to check one room (5 minutes after rounding)
- SHIFT_START_END_BUFFER: Minutes removed from total shift time (currently set to 0)

Assumptions:
- A room takes EFFECTIVE_ROOM_CHECK_TIME minutes to check.
- Each room can be checked only once during the two-week period.
- No student is assigned rooms from more than one zone in a single shift.
- Rooms with class conflicts are skipped.
- If a student's shift is too short to check even one room, they are skipped.

This script is designed to maximize room coverage while respecting student time limits and logistical constraints.
